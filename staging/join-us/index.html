      <h1 id="rush">Rush</h1>
      <p>Recruitment otherwise known as "Rush" on college campuses takes place during the first few weeks of a new academic semester or quarter. Fraternities like Pi Alpha Phi will host events for interested members to get to know the Brothers of the Fraternity
        and what the culture is like within the organization. These "rush events", as they're called, are a great way to get a feel of whether or not a Fraternity in particular is right for you. At San José State University, you will find Pi Alpha Phi
        along 7th street plaza during the first two weeks of the Fall and Spring semester. We will be actively taking down contact information and be there to talk to those that are interested in joining a Fraternity and more specifically, Pi Alpha Phi.
        During the first two weeks of each semester, we will also be hosting a number of events for all our interested members, Brothers of our fraternity and Sisters of other sorrorities at San José State University. Near the end of the two week period
        of Rush, we will have an event in particular called "Info Night" where we talk more about our Fratetrnity and answer any questions anybody might have - as opposed to the more social events we host prior to Info Night, this is more of a presentation. This event
        in particular is important because we will be taking down the names of those that are interestd in joining for a personal interview. This is a formal interview we conduct to get to know you more on a personal level, similar to job interviews. After we have conducted our interviews, our Brothers will collectively vote on who we would like to see join our fraternity. An extended offer to join a fraternity is known as a "bid". After deciding on who is to recieve a bid, we will promptly contact you to let you know that you have a bid from our organization, at this point it will be your decision whether you would like to accept or not. Those that accept the offer will go through a New Member Process that includes traditions and rituals unique to our Fraternity (read more in <a class="black-text" href="#faq"><u>FAQ</u></a>).<br/><br/><strong>**Our next rush will be in Fall 2018, to be notified when we will start to have rush <a class="black-text" href="https://goo.gl/forms/ffOI19nfG5tV7wgv2" target="_blank"><u>click here to subscribe to our rush mailing list.</u></a>**</strong></p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <ol>
        <li>Are there any requirements to join?<br/>Anyone interested in joining Pi Alpha Phi at San José State University (SJSU) must be currently enrolled as part-time or full time student at SJSU. The school also requires that anybody interested in joining
          a Fraternity or Sorrority have a 2.6 cumulative GPA otherwise they are prohibited from being able to join the organization (those who are in their first semester at SJSU are exempt from this requirement). </li>
        <li>
          If I am not Asian can I still join?<br/>Although Pi Alpha Phi is an "Asian-interest" fraternity, we are open to individuals of all ethnic backgrounds. The premise of being an "Asian-interest" fraternity is not be an exlcusive fraternity but
          build a community among Asian-Americans, we still however welcome all those interested in joining.
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the New Memeber Process like for Pi Alpha Phi?<br/>Although we can not openly discuss the rituals and traditions of our Fraternity, we can say that the goal of the process is for our potential new members to create a bond among each other and to learn more about our Fraternity in general. Our New Member Process is at the core of our Brotherhood and has been successful in fostering relationships that extend far beyond University setting.
        </li>
        <li>Does Pi Alpha Phi haze?<br/>Nearly all states in the United States including California have anti-hazing laws that prohibit any acts that may be considered to be "hazing by nature", ilegal. At San José State University, there is a strict policy on what can and can not be done during the New Member Process. Our New Member Process has been thrououghly reviewed and vetted by the University and has been approved since our establishment. We can guarentee that Pi Alpha Phi follow the State's and University's rules and regulations when it comes to hazing.
