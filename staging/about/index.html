      <h2 id="history">History</h2>
      <p>The fraternity of Pi Alpha Phi was founded in 1929 at the University of California, Berkely by six individuals: D. Wing Tom, Wing Chan, Elemer Leung, Chack Chan, Tim Jang and George Lee. During this era, the founding fathers of Pi Alpha Phi along
        with many other Asian-Americans faced discrimination in various forms. Student lodging was often not rented to those of Asian heritage, it was the goodwill of a sympathetic German woman known as Mother Tusch, who had also been a victim of racism,
        that gave the founding fathers Wing Chan, Elmer Leong, and D. Wing Tom housing in Mother Tusch's cabin behind her house. Traditional Greek fraternities also legally discriminated against men of color, having explicit policies prohibiting the membership
        of nonwhites and non-Christians. It was during this time that people of different ethnic backgrounds - namely Latino, Black and Asian - began creating their own Greek organizations. It was these forms of racial discrimination that pushed the six
        founding fathers of Pi Alpha Phi together in which they conceived the idea to form a fraternity to serve the several hundred students of Asian descent at the University of California, Berkely. On February 1st, 1929, the six Founding Fathers oficially
        signed the fraternity's constitution and established Pi Alpha Phi at the University of California, Berkely.
