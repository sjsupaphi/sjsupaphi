All content on 'master' branch is deployable
Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file you're making a 'commit' to the branch
'Pull requests' let you tell others abut chances you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.
When you create a repository on Github, it exists as a remote repository. You can 'clone' your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
	*git clone (https section from Github)
	
	git commit -a -m "Message"
	git push origin <branchName> *branch name?
